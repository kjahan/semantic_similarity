Semantic Similarity use cases

## Universal Sentence Encoder
[USE](https://www.tensorflow.org/hub/tutorials/semantic_similarity_with_tf_hub_universal_encoder)

The Universal Sentence Encoder encodes text into high dimensional vectors that can be used for text classification, semantic similarity, clustering, and other natural language tasks [Ref](https://towardsdatascience.com/use-cases-of-googles-universal-sentence-encoder-in-production-dd5aaab4fc15).

## Semantic Similarity with BERT

## Semantic Textual Similarity with SBERT
[SBERT](https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html)

SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence, text and image embeddings. The initial work is described in our paper [Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10084.pdf).
